Leave granted	FAC
Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court dismissing the writ appeal filed by the appellant on the ground that it was not maintainable	FAC
The appeal was filed u/s.2(1) of the M.P.Uchacha Nyayalay (Khand Nyaypeth Ko Appeal) Adhiniyam,2005	FAC
hereinafter referred to as the 'Act').It was held that the order was passed in exercise of power of superintendence u/art.227 of the Constitution of India,1950 (in short the 'Constitution') against which the Letters Patent Appeal is not maintainable	FAC
The order of learned Single Judge was passed on 9.11.2005.Against the said order,special leave petition was filed which was disposed of by this Court by order dated 16.2.2006.We shall refer to the text of the order later	FAC
The High Court construed as if this Court has only waived the limitation for filing of Letters Patent Appeal and there was no direction to consider the case on merits	FAC
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the order of this Court is very clear and the conclusions of the High Court that merely limitation was waived is contrary to the clear terms of the earlier order of this Court	ARG
Additionally it is submitted that the prayer in the Writ Petition was to quash the order passed by the Assistant Commissioner,Commercial Tax	ARG
That being so,the mere fact that the writ petition was styled u/art.227 of the Constitution is of no consequence	Ratio
It is the nature of the relief sought for and the controversy involved which determines the Article which is applicable	Ratio
Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand supported the impugned judgment of the High Court	Ratio
The earlier order passed by this Court dated 22.8.2006 reads as follows: "Heard	FAC
Since the impugned order is passed by a learned Single Judge	FAC
The normal remedy is to file a Letters Patent Appeal	FAC
Since we had entertained the Special Leave Petition against the learned Single Judge's order it would be appropriate to grant three weeks' time to the petitioner to prefer the LPA which if otherwise free from defect shall be entertained for being considered on merits	FAC
The interim order passed by this Court shall continue for the aforesaid purpose	FAC
The Special Leave Petition is disposed of accordingly	FAC
Underlined for emphasis	FAC
A bare reading of the order shows that the direction was to consider the LPA on merits and time was granted to prefer the LPA within three weeks	Ratio
The High Court was directed to dispose of the LPA on merits if it was otherwise free from defect	Ratio
The High Court was,therefore,not justified in holding that this Court's earlier order only waived the limitation for filing a Letters Patent Appeal	Ratio
On that score alone the High Court's order is unsustainable	Ratio
In addition,the High Court seems to have gone by the nomenclature gone by the nomenclature i.e.the discription given in the writ petition to be one u/art.227 of the Constitution	Ratio
The High Court did not consider the nature of the controversy and the prayer involved in the Writ petition	Ratio
As noted above the prayer was to quash the order of assessment passed by the Assistant Commissioner,Commercial Tax levying purchase as well as Entry Tax	Ratio
S.2 of the Act reads as follows: "2(1	STA
An appeal shall lie from a judgment or order passed by the one Judge of the High Court in exercise of original jurisdiction u/art.226 of the Constitution of India,to a Division bench comprising of two judges of the same High Court	STA
Provided that no such appeal shall lie against an interlocutory order or against an order passed in exercise of supervisory jurisdiction u/art.227 of the Constitution of India	STA
This Court in Hari Vishnu Kamath v	PRE
Syed Ahmad Ishaque and Ors.(AIR 1955 SC 233 1954 Indlaw SC 212) held that the High Court while issuing writ of certiorari u/art.226 of the Constitution can only annul a decision of a Tribunal whereas u/art.227 of the Constitution it can issue further directions as well	PRE
As noted above the prayer in the Writ Petition was to set aside the decision of the assessing officer	FAC
In Umaji Keshao Meshram v	PRE
Radhikabai [AIR 1986 SC 1272 1986 Indlaw SC 651	PRE
it was noted as follows	PRE
U/art.226 an order,direction or writ is to issue to a person,authority or the State	PRE
In a proceeding under that article the person,authority or State against whom the direction,order or writ is sought is a necessary party	PRE
Under Article 227,however,what comes up before the High Court is the order or judgment of a subordinate court or tribunal for the purpose of ascertaining whether in giving such judgment or order that subordinate court or tribunal has acted within its authority and according to law	PRE
Prior to the commencement of the Constitution,the Chartered High Courts as also the Judicial Committee had held that the power to issue prerogative writs possessed by the Chartered High Courts was an exercise of original jurisdiction (see Mahomedalli Allabux v	PRE

the Judicial Committee held: "In Their Lordships' opinion any original civil jurisdiction possessed by the High Court and not in express terms conferred by the Letters Patent or later enactments falls within the description of ordinary original civil jurisdiction	PRE
By Art.226 the power of issuing prerogative writs possessed by the Chartered High Courts prior to the commencement of the Constitution has been made wider and more extensive and conferred upon every High Court	Ratio
The nature of the exercise of the power under Article 226,however,remains the same as in the case of the power of issuing prerogative writs possessed by the Chartered High Courts	Ratio
A series of decisions of this Court has firmly established that a proceeding u/art.226 is an original proceeding and when it concerns civil rights,it is an original civil proceeding (see,for instance,State of U.P.v	PRE

Ram Tahel Ramnand (AIR 1972 SC 1598 1972 Indlaw SC 378	PRE
It was noted as follows	PRE
The non obstante clause in Rule 18,namely,"Notwithstanding anything contained in Rules 1,4 and 17 of this chapter",makes it abundantly clear why that rule uses the words "finally disposed of".As seen above,under Rules 1 and 17,applications u/arts.226 and 227 are required to be heard and disposed of by a Division Bench	PRE
Rule 4,however,gives power to a Single Judge to issue rule nisi on an application u/art.226	PRE
but precludes him from passing any final order on such application	PRE
It is because a Single Judge has no power under Rules 1,4 and 17 to hear and dispose of a petition u	PRE
art.226 or 227 that the non obstante clause has been introduced in Rule 18.The use of the words "be heard and finally disposed of by a Single Judge" in Rule 18 merely clarifies the position that in such cases the power of the Single Judge is not confined merely to issuing a rule nisi	PRE
These words were not intended to bar a right of appeal	PRE
To say that the words "finally disposed of" mean finally disposed of so far as the High Court is concerned is illogical because Rules 1,4 and 7 use the words "be heard and disposed of by a Divisional Bench" and were the reasoning of the Full Bench correct,it would mean that so far as the High Court is concerned,when a Single Judge hears a matter and disposes it of,it is finally disposed of and when a Division Bench disposes it of,it is not finally disposed of	PRE
The right of appeal against the judgment of a Single Judge is given by the Letters Patent which have been continued in force by Art.225 of the Constitution	PRE
If under the Rules of the High Court,a matter is heard and disposed of by a Single Judge,an appeal lies against his judgment unless it is barred either under the Letters Patent or some other enactment	PRE
The word "finally" used in Rule 18 of Chapter XVII of the Appellate Side Rules does not and cannot possibly have the effect of barring a right of appeal conferred by the Letters Patent	PRE
As we have seen above,an intra-court appeal against the judgment of a Single Judge in a petition u/art.226 is not barred while cl.15 itself bars an intra-court appeal against the judgment of a Single Judge in a petition u/art.227	PRE
In Sushilabai Laxminarayan Mudliyar v	PRE
Nihalchand Waghajibhai Shaha [1993 Supp.(1) SCC 11 1991 Indlaw SC 718	PRE
this court with reference to an unreported judgment in Ratnagiri District Central Co-operative Bank Ltd.v	PRE
Dinkar Kashinath Watve 1989 Indlaw SC 421,C.A.No.520 of 1989 decided on 27.1.1989 held as follows: "Even when in the cause title of an application both Art.226 and Art.227 of the Constitution have been mentioned,the learned single Judge is at liberty to decide,according to facts of each particular case,whether the said application ought to be dealt with only u/art.226 of the Constitution	PRE
For determining the question of maintainability of an appeal against such a judgment of the Single Judge the Division bench has to find out whether in substance the judgment has been passed by the learned Single Judge in exercise of the jurisdiction u/art.226 of the Constitution	PRE
In the event in passing his judgment on an application which had mentioned in its cause title both Arts.226 and 227,the Single Judge has in fact invoked only his supervisory powers under Article 227,the appeal under cl.15 would not lie	PRE
The cl.15 of the Letters Patent expressly bars appeals against orders of Single Judges passed under revisional or supervisory powers	PRE
Even when the learned Single Judge's order has been passed under both the articles,for deciding the maintainability against such an order what would be relevant is the principal or main relief granted by the judgment passed by learned Single Judge and not the ancillary directions given by him	PRE
The expression 'ancillary' means,in the context,incidental or consequential to the main part of the order	PRE
Thus,the determining factor is the real nature of principal order passed by the Single Judge which is appealed against and neither the mentioning in the cause title of the application of both the articles nor the granting of ancillary orders thereupon made by learned Single Judge would be relevant	PRE
Thus,in each case,the Division Bench may consider the substance of the judgment under appeal to ascertain whether the Single Judge has mainly or principally exercised in the matter his jurisdiction	PRE
u/art.226 or u/art.227.In	PRE
the event in his judgment the learned Single Judge himself had mentioned the particular article of the Constitution under which he was passing his judgment,in an appeal under cl.15 against such a judgment it may not be necessary for the appellate bench to elaborately examine the question of its maintainability	PRE
When without mentioning the particular article the learned Single Judge decided on merits the application,in order to decide the question of maintainability of an appeal,against such a judgment,the Division Bench might examine the relief granted by the learned Single Judge,for maintainability of an appeal,the determination would be the main and not the ancillary relief	PRE
When a combined application u/arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution is summarily dismissed without reasons,the appeal Court may consider whether the facts alleged,warranted filing of the application u/art.226 or u/art.227 of the Constitution	PRE
Thereafter this Court explained the ratio laid down in the case of Umaji's case1986 Indlaw SC 651 (supra) and expressed thus: "In Umaji case it was clearly held that where the facts justify a party in filing an application either u/art.226 or 227 of the Constitution of India and the party chooses to file his application under both these articles in fairness of justice to party and in order not to deprive him of valuable right of appeal the Court ought to treat the application as being made under Article 226,and if in deciding the matter,in the final order the Court gives ancillary directions which may pertain to Article 227,this ought not to be held to deprive a party of the right of appeal under cl.15 of the Letters Patent where the substantial part of the order sought to be appealed against is u/art.226.Rule 18 of the Bombay High Court Appellate Side Rules read with cl.15 of the Letters Patent provides for appeal to the Division Bench of the High Court from a judgment of the learned Single Judge passed on a writ petition u/art.226 of the Constitution	PRE
In the present case the Division Bench was clearly wrong in holding that the appeal was not maintainable against the order of the learned Single Judge	PRE
In Mangalbhai & Ors.v	PRE
Radhyshyam (Dr	PRE
AIR 1993 SC 806 1992 Indlaw SC 509] it was inter alia observed as follows: "The learned Single Judge in his impugned judgment dated December 11,1987 nowhere mentioned that he was exercising the powers u/art.227 of the Constitution	PRE
The learned Single Judge examined the matter on merit and set aside the orders of the Rent Controller as well as the Resident Deputy Collector on the ground that the aforesaid judgments were perverse	PRE
The findings of the Rent Controller and Resident Deputy Collector were set aside on the question of habitual defaulter as well as on the ground of bona fide need	PRE
Thus in the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case,the pleadings of the parties in the writ petition and the judgment of the learned Single Judge leaves no manner of doubt that it was an order passed u/art.226 of the Constitution and in that view of the matter the Letters Patent Appeal was maintainable before the High Court	PRE
After taking the aforesaid view one course open was to set aside the order of the Division Bench and to remand the matter for being disposed of on merits by the Division Bench of the High Court	PRE
However,taking in view the fact that this litigation is going on for nearly a decade and also the fact that even the learned Single Judge in his impugned order dated December 11,1987 had remanded the case to the Rent Controller,we considered it proper in the interest of justice to hear the appeal on merits against the judgment of the learned Single Judge	PRE
We have heard learned counsel for the parties at length on the merits of the case	PRE
In Lokmat Newspapers (P	PRE
Shankarprasad [1999 (6) SCC 275 1999 Indlaw SC 587	PRE
it was observed as follows: "It is,therefore,obvious that the writ petition invoking jurisdiction of the High Court both u/arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution had tried to make out a case for the High Court's interference seeking issuance of an appropriate writ of certiorari u/art.226 of the Constitution of India	PRE
Basic averments for invoking such a jurisdiction were already pleaded in the writ petition for the High Court's consideration	PRE
It is true,as submitted by learned counsel for the appellant,that the order of the learned Single Judge nowhere stated that the Court was considering the writ petition u/art.226 of the Constitution of India	PRE
It is equally true that the learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition by observing that the courts below had appreciated the contentions and rejected the complaint	PRE
But the said observation of the learned Single Judge did not necessarily mean that the learned Judge was not inclined to interfere u/art.227 of the Constitution of India only	PRE
The said observation equally supports the conclusion that the learned Judge was not inclined to interfere u/arts.226 and 227.As seen earlier,he was considering the aforesaid writ petition moved u/art.226 as well as Art.227 of the Constitution of India	PRE
Under these circumstances,it is not possible to agree with the contention of learned counsel for the appellant that the learned Single Judge had refused to interfere only u/art.227 of the Constitution of India when he dismissed the writ petition of the respondent	PRE
In this connection,it is profitable to have a look at the decision of this Court in the case of Umaji Keshao Meshram v	PRE
Radhikabai [1986 Supp.SCC 401 1986 Indlaw SC 651].In	PRE
that case O.Chinnappa Reddy and D.P.Madon	PRE
JJ.,considered the very same question in the light of cl.15 of the Letters Patent of the Bombay High Court	PRE
Madon,J.,speaking for the Court  made the following pertinent observations: "Petitions are at times filed both u/arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution	PRE
The case of Hari Vishnu Kamath v	PRE
Syed Ahmad Ishaque (AIR 1955 SC 233 1954 Indlaw SC 212) before this Court was of such a type	PRE
Rule 18 provides that where such petitions are filed against orders of the tribunals or authorities specified in Rule 18 of Chapter XVII of the Appellate Side Rules or against decrees or orders of courts specified in that rule,they shall be heard and finally disposed of by a Single Judge	PRE
The question is whether an appeal would lie from the decision of the Single Judge in such a case	PRE
In our opinion,where the facts justify a party in filing an application either u/art.226 or 227 of the Constitution,and the party chooses to file his application under both these articles,in fairness and justice to such party and in order not to deprive him of the valuable right of appeal the court ought to treat the application as being made under Article 226,and if in deciding the matter,in the final order the court gives ancillary directions which may pertain to Article 227,this ought not to be held to deprive a party of the right of appeal under cl.15 of the Letters Patent where the substantial part of the order sought to ^*296be appealed against is u	PRE

Peoples' Coop	PRE
Transport Society Ltd.(AIR 1961 Punj 24 1960 Indlaw PNH 196) and we are in agreement with it	PRE
The aforesaid decision squarely gets attracted on the facts of the present case	Ratio
It was open to the respondent to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court both u/arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution of India	Ratio
Once such a jurisdiction was invoked and when his writ petition was dismissed on merits,it cannot be said that the learned Single Judge had exercised his jurisdiction only u/art.226  of the Constitution of India	Ratio
This conclusion directly flows from the relevant averments made in the writ petition and the nature of jurisdiction invoked by the respondent as noted by the learned Single Judge in his judgment,as seen earlier	Ratio
Consequently,it could not be said that cl.15 of the Letters Patent was not attracted for preferring appeal against the judgment of the learned Single Judge	Ratio
It is also necessary to note that the appellant being the respondent in letters patent appeal joined issues on merits and did not take up the contention that the letters patent appeal was not maintainable	Ratio
For all these reasons,therefore,the primary objection to the maintainability of the letters patent appeal as canvassed by learned counsel for the appellant,has to be repelled	Ratio
Point 1 is,therefore,answered in the affirmative against the appellant and in favour of the respondent	Ratio
It takes us to the consideration of points arising for our decision on merits	Ratio

Ashok Hurra [AIR 2002 SC 1771 2002 Indlaw SC 1966],this Court held as follows: "From the aforesaid enunciation of law it is quite vivid and luminescent that the pleadings in the writ petition,nature of the order passed by the learned Single Judge,character and the contour of the order,directions issued,nomenclature given the jurisdictional prospective in the Constitutional context are to be perceived	PRE
It cannot be said in a hypertechnical manner that an order passed in a writ petition,if there is assail to the order emerging from the inferior tribunal or subordinate Court has to be treated all the time for all purposes to be u/art.227 of the Constitution of India	PRE
Phraseology used in exercise of original jurisdiction u/art.226 of the Constitution in S.2 of the Act cannot be given a restricted and constricted meaning because an order passed in a writ petition can tantamount to an order u/art.226 or 227 of the Constitution of India and it would depend upon the real nature of the order passed by the learned Single Judge	PRE
To elaborate; whether the learned Single Judge has exercised his jurisdiction u/art.226 or u/art.227 or both would depend upon various aspects and many a facet as has been emphasized in the afore quoted decisions of the apex Court	PRE
The pleadings,as has been indicated hereinabove,also assume immense significance	PRE
As has been held in the case of Surya Devi Rai (supra) a writ of certiorari can be issued u/art.226 of the Constitution against an order of a Tribunal or an order passed by the sub ordinate court	PRE
In quintessentiality,it cannot be put in a state jacket formula that any order of the learned judge that deals with an order arising from an inferior tribunal or the sub ordinate court is an order u/art.227 of the Constitution of India and not an order u/art.226 of the Constitution	PRE
It would not be an over emphasis to state that an order in a writ petition can fit into the subtle contour of Arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution in a composite manner and they can coincide,co-exit,overlap imbricate	PRE
In this context it is apt to note that there may be cases where the learned single judge may feel disposed or inclined to issue a writ to do full and complete justice because it is to be borne in mind that Art.226 of the Constitutions is fundamentally a repository and reservoir of justice based on equity and good conscience	PRE
It will depend upon factual matrix of the case	PRE
Thus,there is no manner of doubt that the orders and proceedings of a judicial court subordinate to the High Court are amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court u/art.226 of the Constitution	PRE
Upon a review of decided cases and a survey of the occasions,wherein the High Courts have exercised jurisdiction to command a writ of certiorari or to exercise supervisory jurisdiction u/art.227 in the given facts and circumstances in a variety of cases,it seems that the distinction between the two jurisdictions stands almost obliterated in practice	PRE
Probably,this is the reason why it has become customary with the lawyers labelling their petitions as one common u/arts.226 and 227 of the Constitution,though such practice has been deprecated in some judicial pronouncement	PRE
Without entering into niceties and technicality of the subject,we venture to state the broad general difference between the two jurisdictions	PRE
Firstly,the writ of certiorari is an exercise of its original jurisdiction by the High Court; exercise of supervisory jurisdiction is not an original jurisdiction and in this sense it is akin to appellate,revisional or corrective jurisdiction	PRE
Secondly,in a writ of certiorari,the record of the proceedings having been certified and sent up by the inferior court or tribunal to the High Court,the High Court if inclined to exercise its jurisdiction,may simply annul or quash the proceedings and then do no more	PRE
In exercise of supervisory jurisdiction,the High Court may not only quash or set aside the impugned proceedings,judgment or order but it may also make such directions as the facts and circumstances of the case may warrant,maybe,by way of guiding the inferior court or tribunal as to the manner in which it would now proceed further or afresh as commended to or guided by the High Court	PRE
In appropriate cases the High Court,while exercising supervisory jurisdiction,may substitute such a decision of its own in place of the impugned decision,as the inferior court or tribunal should have made	PRE
Lastly,the jurisdiction u/art.226 of the Constitution is capable of being exercised on a prayer made by or on behalf of the party aggrieved; the supervisory jurisdiction is capable of being exercised suo motu as well	PRE
In view of what has been stated above,the High Court was not justified in holding that the Letters Patent Appeal was not maintainable	Ratio
In addition,a bare reading of this Court's earlier order shows that the impugned order is clearly erroneous	Ratio
The impugned order is set aside	RPC
The writ appeal shall be heard by the Division Bench on merits	RPC
The appeal is allowed	RPC
