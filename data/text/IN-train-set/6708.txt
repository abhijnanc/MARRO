Ram Avtar, PW 3 and D 3 Ram Nath, first cousin, had liquor contract in the village Kotli Ablu from 1983 and 1984.	FAC
D 2 and PW 4 were working in the liquor shop.	FAC
The wives of D 2 and D 4 are sisters.	FAC
D 4 came to see D 2.	FAC
D 1 was working in the liquor shop at Ablowbad.	FAC
Since the liquor therein had exhausted he came to Kotli Ablu to sell the liquor in the shop of D 3.	FAC
A 1 and A 2 are brothers and are residents of Kotli Ablu and Sohna Singh, A 3 is their maternal uncle (mother 's brother) and a resident of Rameana situated at a distance of 8 km.	FAC
to Kotli Ablu.	FAC
These are the admitted facts.	FAC
It is the case of the prosecution that at about 9.00 p.m. On June 4, 1984, A 1 and A 3 came to the liquor shop of D 3 wherein PW 3, D 1, D 2 and PW 4 were also present and were vending the liquor.	FAC
They sold one bottle of liquor to A 1 and A 3 on credit.	FAC
After its consumption A 1 and A 3 demanded another bottle to which D 3 refused to sell on credit.	FAC
Thereon A 1 and A 3 abused them and a quarrel ensued.	FAC
Both left the shop in anger.	FAC
D 1 and D 2 slept on a cot in front of the liquor shop.	FAC
D 3 and D 4 slept wooden takthposh in front of the liquor shop.	FAC
PW 3 and PW 4 climbed the roof of the shop and slept there.	FAC
During past midnight of June 4 5, 1984 at about 12.30 a.m. PW 3 and PW 4 heard gun shot fire and got up and saw with visibility of electric light emanating 262 from the house of one Gurbax Singh whose son was examined on DW 2 that A 1 was firing with rifle at D 1 to D 4 and A 2 and A 3 hitting them with Gandasas (sharp edged weapons).	FAC
Seeing PW 3 and PW 4 on the terrace A 1 fired at them but they escaped uninjured and they jumped down.	FAC
PW 3 jumped towards back side of the shop and ran towards the village and hid in the school.	FAC
PW 4 jumped to the front side and ran towards the village.	FAC
A 1 fired at PW 4 and A 2 hit him.	FAC
He received seven bullet injuries fired by A 1 on the backside, of right, leg, thigh and left side of the abdomen while he was running.	FAC
A 2 hit him on the right shoulder and had incised injury.	FAC
He ran to the house of Gurmail Singh, PW 3 with bleeding injuries, knocked the door and fell down unconscious.	FAC
On June 5, 1984 at about 9.00 a.m. Jit Singh, the Chowkidar of the village reached Kotli Police Station and reported to PW 5, S.H.O. who reduced Ex.P 24 into writing.	FAC
In the F.I.R. he stated that he had heard gun shot firing from the side of the liquor shop.	FAC
Due to fear and the prevailing tense situation he did not come out.	FAC
Next day morning he saw several people collected at the liquor shop and saw the dead bodies of D 1 to D 4 and PW 4 was lying unconscious in the house of DW 3 and he was asked to report the matter accordingly.	FAC
PW 5 after issuing F.I.R. to all the concerned, went alongwith police party to the spot at noon and saw the dead bodies.	FAC
He went to the house of DW 3 and found PW 4 under shock and unconscious.	FAC
He sent him for medical examination by PW 2, the Doctor as his condition was serious.	FAC
PW 3 on coming to know the arrival of the police and the military people at noon mustered courage and came out from the school and went to the shop.	FAC
He was examined at the inquest and he also attested the statement recorded by the police at the inquest.	FAC
PW 5 enclosed the copies of his statement to the inquest report Ex.P 4, P 6, P 8 and P 10 and sent the dead bodies with the reports for post mortem by PW 2 Doctor.	FAC
He also prepared rough sketch of the scene under Ex P1/A.	FAC
He recovered the blood stained earth and cots etc under exhibit	FAC
He recovered 7 empty and two live cartridges exhibit M 0/1 to M 0/9 under panchnama Ex.p 18.	FAC
He remained on the spot till 10.30 p.m. and saw the light emanating from the house of Gurbax Singh and falling at the scene of occurrence.	FAC
He sent requisition twice to the hospital to find whether PW 4 was in a fit condition for recording his statement.	FAC
On June 7, 1984 at about 7.00 a.m. he received an endorsement that PW 4 was in a fit condition to make the statement.	FAC
Accordingly he recorded the statement.	FAC
He sent M.O.S.1 to 9 cartridges and pellets recovered from body of D 4 under exhibitP 25 to ballistic expert for report.	FAC
on June 15, 1984 when he was picketing on the drain of village Chand Bhan at about 3.30 a.m. he arrested the appellants and recovered from the person of A 1.	FAC
exhibit 263 M 0/11 rifle, 351 bore (semi automatic) of U.S.A. make loaded with two cartridges M 0/12 and M 0/13 under panchnama in the presence of panch.	FAC
Pursuant to a statement made under s.27 Evidence Act by A 3 leading to discover Gandasa M 0/14 was recovered under ex.P 27 and sent them to the chemical examination and the ballistic reports.	FAC
Under exhibitP 28, the Ballistic expert found that the empties exhibit M 0/1 to M 0/9 had been fired from rifle exhibit M 0/11.	FAC
Gandasa was stained with human blood as per the report exhibit PW 2 who conducted the post mortem on D 1 and D 2 found on each of the dead bodies two gun shot entry and exit wounds.	FAC
D 3 and D 4 were found to have 4 gun shot lacerated and two incised injuries and 5 lacerated and two incised injuries respectively.	FAC
He removed M.O.S.16 and 17 pellet from the body of D 4.	FAC
He issued post mortem certificates Ex.P 3, P 5, P 7 and P 9 respectively.	FAC
He also examined PW 4.	FAC
He found as many as 7 lacerated gun shot injuries and one incised injury and issued medical certificate Ex.	FAC
Injuries and one incised injury and issued medical certificate exhibit Injuries 1 to 7 were caused by gun shot fire and injury 8 by a sharp weapon.	FAC
PW 5 sent two pellets recovered by him from the body of D 4 to the Ballistic and Chemical Examination.	FAC
The defence consented to mark F.I.R., the affidavits of panch witnesses and constables; the fire arms licence of A 1 under exhibit P 17 and also the reports of the ballistic expert and chemical examination reports without oral evidence.	FAC
PW 6, the Deputy Superintendent of Police supervised the investigation conducted by PW 5.	FAC
The prosecution examined 6 witnesses and defence examined 3 witnesses and marked the documents.	FAC
The accused were examined 3 witnesses and marked the documents.	FAC
The accused were examined under s.313 and denied their complicity and examined DW 1 to DW 3 to prove that the bulb of Gurbax Singh was not burning and PW 3 was residing at Medhak and he was brought to Kotli Ablu by the Police and PW 4 was conscious and did not disclose the names of the appellants at that time.	FAC
The lower court believed the direct evidence of PW 3 and PW 4 and the prosecution case that A 1 fired at the deceased with M 0/11 rifle, A 2 and A 3 also participated in the attack.	FAC
If also found that M 0/11, the rifle belongs to A 1 and he fired the deceased and PW 4.	FAC
Accordingly convicted them for an offences under sections 302/34 and 307/34 I.P.C. When they were asked under s.235(2), they declined to lead evidence and the Sessions Court awarded sentence to the accused as referred to earlier.	FAC
Shri Lalit, the learned senior counsel for the appellants contended that the evidence of PW 3 and PW 4 is highly artificial, unbelievable and untrustworthy; barring their evidence, there is no other evidence to connect the appellants with the commission of the crime.	FAC
The story that PW 3 and PW 4 climbed on the terrace and were sleeping is 264 false as they cannot climb to a height of 8/1/2 ft. PW 3 did not disclose his witnessing the occurrence to any one till noon.	FAC
DW 3 the Sarpanch of Madhok spoke that PW 3 alongwith the panch witnesses were brought from Madhok in a Jeep by the police, so he is a planted witness.	FAC
In support thereof he contends that the specific evidence of DW 3 in this regard was not challenged in cross examination.	FAC
PW 4 was not examined at the inquest though he was conscious.	FAC
The police requisitioned the dog squad to sniff the scene of offence to identify the unknown accused.	FAC
PW 5 and PW 2 the Doctor admitted that the omission of the names of the accused in the case diary and memos would belie the theory of witnesses.	FAC
The omission of the names of the accused in the cause title (Banam) would clearly show that PW 3 and PW 4 were not direct witnesses and PW 3 was introduced at a later stage and he was not examined at the inquest and that PW 4 did not identify the appellants.	FAC
This was also further corroborated from the fact that admittedly exhibit P 24, recited that three unknown assailants had killed the deceased.	FAC
Admittedly the dog squad was requisitioned.	FAC
The appellants were falsely implicated.	FAC
As regards PW 4, he further contended that as per the evidence of DW 2 son of Gurbux Singh and DW 3, Gurmail Singh, PW 4 was conscious at that time of his coming to the house of DW 3 and remained to be conscious.	FAC
The police did not examine him till June 7, 1984 as the assailants were not known.	FAC
There was no light in the house of DW 1 and PW 3 and PW 4 could not have identified the assailants.	FAC
The theory of liquor vending is doubtful for the reason that the entire State was under curfew on that day due to blue star operation on June 3, 1984 and no vending would take place when there is a curfew.	FAC
If really the appellants 1 and 3 had taken the liquor on credit, nothing prevented the prosecution to produce the chit admittedly taken by D 3.	FAC
The theory of burning the shop shows that it is an act of terrorists as was noted in the case diary by PW 6.	FAC
Thus the appellants were implicated by suspicion and the prosecution had not established the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.	FAC
The conviction and sentence by the special court was on the same day, namely May 29, 1985 which contravenes the mandatory provision of s.235 of the Code.	FAC
In view of the decision of this court in Allauddin vs State of M.P., J.T.(1989) 2 SC 171 and Anguswamy vs State of Tamilnadu, J.T. the sentence of death awarded to A 1 is illegal.	FAC
A 2 had no axe to grind against the deceased.	FAC
He neither went for drinking at 9.00 p.m. on that day nor had a quarrel.	FAC
He bears no motive to kill the deceased or attack PW 4.	FAC
No recovery of Gandasa was made from him.	FAC
PW 3 and PW 4 have no prior acquaintance with him.	FAC
Therefore, it was highly doubtful whether A 2 had participated in the offence.	FAC
As regards to the third 265 appellant (A 3), it is his contention that he is a resident of Rameana.	FAC
PW 3 or PW 4 do not know A 6 at all.	FAC
Therefore, he may not be able to have participated in the crime.	FAC
It was resisted by Mr.Das Bahl, learned counsel for the State.	FAC
The acceptance of the prosecution case rests on the evidence of PW 3 and PW 4.	FAC
PW 3 and D 3 had the licence to vend liquor at Kotli Ablu.	FAC
PW 4 and D 2 were vending liquor under them.	FAC
D 4 came to see D 2 as they were married sisters.	FAC
D 1 came and was vending on the fateful day in the shop.	FAC
D 1 to D 4 were killed in the intervening night of June 4 5, 1984 is practically admitted from the evidence of DW 3.	FAC
During the course of the same transaction PW 4 sustained 7 lacerated gunshot injuries and one incised injury is also admitted through the evidence of DW 2 and DW 3, PW 2, the Doctor 's evidence conclusively established that D 1 and D 2 died due to gun shot injuries.	FAC
D 1 and D 2 each had two entry and exit wounds due to gun shots.	FAC
D 3 and D 4 also had gunshot lacerated as well as incised injuries.	FAC
They also died on the spot due to the injuries which are sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.	FAC
Seven empty and two live cartridge fired from M 0/11 rifle of 351 bore of U.S.A. make belonging to A 1 were recovered from the scene of occurrence.	FAC
Therefore, the deaths of D 1 and D 2 due to gunshot injuries and D 3 and D 4 due to gunshot and incised injuries are proved beyond doubt.	FAC
Equally PW 4 sustained injuries is also established.	FAC
The only question is whether the appellants are assailants.	Ratio
The conviction of the appellants hinges upon the acceptability of the testimony of PW 3 and PW 4.	Ratio
Let us first take the evidence of PW 4, the injured witness whose presence at the time of occurrence stands confirmed.	Ratio
He is aged about 19 years.	Ratio
He was working in the liquor shop of D 3 and PW 3 at Kotli Ablu.	Ratio
He is residing in that village was not disputed.	Ratio
As stated earlier he sustained 8 injuries (7 gunshot and one incised) during the course of the same transaction is also indisputable, and in fairness, was not disputed by Shri Lalit.	Ratio
His serious attack is that PW 4 did not disclose the names of the assailants for two days which would show that he did not either see the assailants or the assailants were not known him.	Ratio
We find it difficult to accept.	Ratio
His case that he jumped from the terrace in front of the shop and he was attacked by the assailants was not disputed in the cross examination.	Ratio
The suggestion that he was sleeping alongwith D 4 would show that he could see A 1 who fired at him while he was running away and it receives corroboration from medical evidence of PW 2 that the injuries are on the backside while he was chased by the accused.	Ratio
So he 266 could clearly identify his own assailants as the occurrence did not take place at a fleet or glimpse.	Ratio
In the F.I.R. at the earliest, it was specifically stated that PW 4 was not in a condition to speak.	Ratio
It would mean that he was either under shock or unconscious.	Ratio
The First Information Report given by the Chowkidar was admitted in evidence with the consent of the defence.	Ratio
It is settled law that the First Information Report is not substantive evidence.	Ratio
It can be used only to contradict the maker thereof or for corroborating his evidence and also to show that the implication of the accused was not an after thought.	Ratio
Since the examination of first information was dispensed with by consent Ex P 24, F.I.R. became part of the prosecution evidence.	Ratio
Under section 11 of the Evidence Act read with s.6 the facts stated therein namely, PW 4 was not in a speaking condition, could be used only as a relevant fact of prior existing state of facts in issue as resgestae of "the earliest information".	Ratio
It is not used to corroborate the prosecution case, but can be looked into as an earliest information of the existing condition of PW 4 at 9.00 a.m. on June 5, 1984 i.e. when the report was given in exhibit p 24, PW 4 was still unconscious.	Ratio
When PW 4 had stated that he became unconscious as soon as he came and tapped the door of DW 3, and fell down, by operation of section 11 of the Evidence Act it may be relevant fact of the previous existing condition that PW 4 contained to remain unconscious till the report was given.	Ratio
Therefore, the F.I.R. could be used as relevant existing state of fact namely the continuous unconscious condition of PW 4 till PW 5 S.H.O.reached and saw him within the meaning of s.11 read with s.6 of the Evidence Act.	Ratio
When PW 4 received 7 gun shot injuries and one incised injury and ran for life to a distance with bleeding injuries, it would be quite likely that he would be under severe shock and his evidence that after reaching the home of DW 3 and knocked the door he fell down unconscious appears to be quite natural and probable.	Ratio
The evidence of PW 5, that on seeing PW 4 in critical unconscious condition he sent him to the Doctor for medical examination and the doctor administering sadation appear to be human probabilities and there is nothing intrinsic to suspect their evidence.	Ratio
Thus PW 4 was not in a fit condition to give statement till June 7, 1984 at 7.00 a.m. PW 4 's evidence that he was residing at Kotli Ablu and that he knew the accused was not disputed in the cross examination.	Ratio
It is not uncommon in normal human probability that he was not expected to know the names of the relations of A 3.	Ratio
When A 1 and A 3 came in that very night to the shop and quarreled for non supply of liquor on credit, it would be fresh in the memory of PW 4 and as he saw the assailants he could have easily recognized A 3. 267 Undoubtedly, ocular defence evidence, if it is not subjected to critical cross examination, is entitled to the same weight as prosecution evidence.	Ratio
But merely because the prosecution, as usual, made insipid cross examination, the defence evidence is not to be believed automatically.	Ratio
Witnesses may be prone to speak lies but circumstances will not.	Ratio
So even though the burden of the defence is not as heavy as of the prosecution, the oral evidence tendered by the defence must also be subjected to critical scrutiny and be considered in the light of the given facts and attending circumstances of the case and human probabilities.	Ratio
The evidence on record is clear that PW 4 was left attended, though was lying with injuries at the house of DW 3, till the investigating officer PW 5 came and saw him in critical condition.	Ratio
The normal human conduct, which is common in the country side, is to give immediate first aid and then to make inquire of the cause for injuries and the persons who caused the same.	Ratio
As DW 3 betrayed such conduct, make us to suspect the credibility and veracity of his evidence and of DW 2 that PW 4 was conscious all through and that he did not disclose the assailants ' names.	Ratio
Therefore, the evidence of DW 2 and DW 3 that PW 4 was professed to have disclaimed the names of the assailants is unbelievable despite no specific cross examination was directed on that aspect.	Ratio
That apart they did not tender themselves to be examined by PW 5, the investigating officer.	Ratio
As regards the shedding of the light from the house of Gurbax Singh is concerned, there is uncontroverted evidence of PW 5, that he remained in the village till 9.30 p.m. on June 5, 1984 to see whether the light was emanating from the house of Gurbax Singh and found to be so and sufficient for PW 3 and PW 4 to identify the assailants.	Ratio
No cross examination on this aspect was directed.	Ratio
Gurbax Singh, the owner of the house was not examined by the defence.	Ratio
Only his son DW 2, an youngster, came into the box and perjured the evidence.	Ratio
Therefore, the claim that the light was not working for three months prior to the date of occurrence, cannot be believed.	Ratio
Even assuming that there was no light, even then, PW 4 could identify his own assailants when he was attacked and chased in the course of the same transaction.	Ratio
Nothing worthwhile was brought out in the cross examination to disbelieve his testimony.	Ratio
He had no axe to grind against any of the accused.	Ratio
To motive to make false implication of the accused was even suggested.	Ratio
He cannot be expected to allow his own assailants to go unpunished and would implicate innocent persons.	Ratio
Moreover the medical evidence of PW 2 fully corroborated the evidence of PW 4.	Ratio
It is settled law that corroboration is not a rule of law, but one of caution as an assurance.	Ratio
The conviction could be made on the basis of 268 the testimony of a solitary witness.	Ratio
The occasion for the presence at the time of occurrence, opportunity to witness the crime, the normal conduct of the witness after the incident, the nearness of the witness to the victim, his pre disposition towards the accused, are some of the circumstances to be kept in view to weigh and accept the ocular evidence of a witness.	Ratio
It is not the quantum of the evidence but its quality and credibility of the witness that lends assurance to the court for acceptance.	Ratio
Considered in this light, we have no hesitation to conclude that PW 4 is a witness of truth and inspires us to believe his evidence.	Ratio
He would, even in the absence of any light have identified the accused, who had attacked him and committed the murders of sleeping, unarmed and innocent D 1 to D 4.	Ratio
The evidence of PW 3, though was severely attacked by Shri Lalit, giving our anxious consideration and subjecting to careful analysis, we find that the Special Court committed no error in accepting his evidence.	Ratio
It is common knowledge that the villagers during summer sleep outside the house, court yard of the house, if any, or on the terrace of the concrete houses.	Ratio
No doubt there is no stairs to the terrace of the shop whose height is only 8 and 1/2 feet.	Ratio
PW 4 and PW 3 being young men it is not difficult to climb up and sleep and now it was proved providential for them.	Ratio
Therefore, the absence of producing, the quilts or lack of steps is not a serious infirmity to doubt the presence of PW 3 and PW 4 and that they slept on the terrace of the shop.	Ratio
In view of curfew and tense condition in the State, it would be unlikely that PW 3 would have traveled in the night to Madhok at a distance of 23 km.	Ratio
The evidence on record clearly shows that the defence has freely used the entries in the case diary as evidence and marked some portions of the diary for contradictions or omissions in the prosecution case.	Ratio
This is clearly in negation of and in the teeth of s.172(3) of the Code.	Ratio
Section 172 reads thus: "Diary of proceedings in investigation. (1) Every police officer making an investigation under this Chapter shall day by day enter his proceedings in the investigation in a diary, setting forthwith the time at which the information reached him, the time at which he began and closed his investigation, the place or places visited by him, and a statement of the circumstances ascertained through his investigation.	STA
269 (2) Any Criminal Court may send for the police diaries of a case under inquiry or trial in such Court, and may use such diaries, not as evidence in the case, but to aid it in such inquiry or trial.	STA
(3) Neither the accused nor his agents shall be entitled to call for such diaries, nor shall he or they be entitled to see them merely because they are referred to by the Court; but, if they are used by the police officer who made them to refresh his memory, or if the Court uses them for the purpose of contradicting such police officer, the provisions of Section 161 or Section 145, as the case may be, of the (1 of 1872) shall apply.	STA
" It is manifest from its bare reading without subjecting to detailed and critical analysis that the case diary is only a record of day to day investigation of the Investigating Officer to ascertain the statement of circumstances ascertained through the investigation.	Ratio
Under sub section(2) the Court is entitled at the trial or enquiry to use the diary not as evidence in the case, but as aid to it in the inquiry or trial.	Ratio
Neither the accused, nor his agent, by operation of sub section(3), shall be entitled to call the diary, nor shall he be entitled to use it as evidence merely because the Court referred to it.	Ratio
Only right given thereunder is that if the police officer who made the entries in the diary uses it to refresh his memory or if the Court uses it for the purpose of contradicting such witness, by operation of s.161 of the Code section 145 of the Evidence Act, it shall be used for the purpose of contradicting the witness, i.e. Investigation Officer or to explain it in re examination by the prosecution, with permission of the court.	Ratio
It is, therefore, clear that unless the investigating officer or the Court uses it either to refresh the memory or contradicting the investigating officer as previous statement under s.161 that too after drawing his attention thereto as is enjoined under s.145 of the Evidence Act.	Ratio
The entries cannot be used by the accused as evidence.	Ratio
Neither PW 5, nor PW 6, nor the court used the case diary.	Ratio
Therefore, the free use thereof for contradicting the prosecution evidence is obviously illegal and it is inadmissible in evidence.	Ratio
Thereby the defence cannot place reliance thereon.	Ratio
But even if we were to consider the same as admissible that part of the evidence does not impinge upon the prosecution evidence.	Ratio
As regards the omission of the names of the appellants in the memos sent to the Medical Officer PW 2 under exhibit D 13 and 15 it is also not evidence except as record of investigation.	Ratio
It is not a rule of 270 law that the memo should bear names with cause title of accused.	Ratio
It is enough if the name of the injured is mentioned in the memo.	Ratio
Therefore, the omission to refer their names after the word Banam in the memos sent to the Doctor would not create any doubt that the appellants were later implicated.	Ratio
Equally the prosecution cannot rely on the statement of PW 3 enclosed to the inquest reports as substantive evidence, as is done and argued with vehemence by Sri Das Bahl.	Ratio
Section 174 of the Code empowers a police officer to investigate in the presence of two or more respectable witnesses and report only the cause of death and the person, if known, that has committed the offence.	STA
Section 175 empowers him to summon any person who appears to be acquainted with the facts of the case and every person so summoned shall be bound to attend the inquest and answer truely all the questions other than questions the answers to which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture.	STA
The statement made by such person is a "previous statement" within the meaning of s.162 and it shall not be signed.	Ratio
So the statement made by such a person to police officer is in the course of the investigation, and when reduced to writing, it shall be used only by the accused to contradict such witness in the manner provided by s.145 of the Evidence Act or with the permission of the court the prosecution could use it for re examination only to explain the matter referred to in his cross examination.	Ratio
It is settled law that s.162 was conceived to protect an accused creating an absolute bar against the previous statement made before the police office being used for any purpose whatsoever.	Ratio
The obvious reason is that the previous statement under the circumstances was not made inspiring confidence.	Ratio
It enables the accused to rely thereon only to contradict the witnesses in the manner provided by s.145 drawing attention of the witness of that part of the statement intended to be used for contradiction.	Ratio
It cannot be used for corroboration of a prosecution or defence witness or even a court witness, nor can it be used contradicting a defence or a court witness.	Ratio
The investigating officer is enjoined to forward the inquest report to the Magistrate alongwith the statement recorded at the inquest, so that the court would see the record, at the earliest of the circumstances leading to the cause of the death of the deceased and the witness examined during the inquest.	Ratio
Therefore, the statement of PW 3 record during inquest is not evidence.	Ratio
It is a previous statement reduced to writing under s.162 of the Code and enclosed to the inquest report and cannot be used by the prosecution for any purpose including to show the names of the accused except to contradict the maker thereof, or to explain the same by prosecution.	Ratio
271 It is true that DW 1 had stated and was not effectively cross examined that PW 3 was brought by the police in a jeep alongwith the Panch.	Ratio
But he was examined at the inquest is evident from the record.	Ratio
PW 3 was present at 9.00 p.m. at the time of vending liquor on credit to A 1 and A 3 and the quarrel.	Ratio
PW 4 stated that PW 3 and himself slept together on the terrace.	Ratio
He was examined at the inquest is corroborated by doctor 's evidence that statement of PW 3 recorded under s.162 was enclosed to the inquest reports and sent to PW 2, the Doctor alongwith the dead bodies.	Ratio
There is ring of truth in the evidence of PW 3.	Ratio
During curfew, in the night he would not have under taken to go to Madhok at a distance of 23 km.	Ratio
The attending circumstances for coming to the scene of offence appear to be natural and probable in the ordinary course of human conduct.	Ratio
Having seen that four of his companions were done to death, the instinct of self preservation and the grip of fear would have made him not to stir out from the school and mustered courage only when the police and the military people arrived at the scene at noon.	Ratio
Thus he came to be examined at the earliest at inquest whereat he disclosed the names and the participation of the appellants.	Ratio
Thus the evidence of PW 3 would lend to corroborate PW 4 's evidence.	Ratio
In addition there is a strong circumstantial evidence against A 1 and A 3.	Ratio
On his arrest on June 15, 1984, M/0/11, rifle was recovered from A 1.	Ratio
As per exhibit P 17 licence, it belongs to him, the ballistic report exhibit P 20 establishes that the empty cartridges exhibit M.1 to M.7 were discharged from the bore of M/0/11.	Ratio
This evidence clearly established that M/0/11 was used by A 1 in the crime.	Ratio
In his examination under s.313, no explanation was given as to how M/0/11 rifle could go out from his custody for being used, in committing the crime by third parties.	Ratio
From its recovery from the person of A 1, it is clear that it continued to remain in his custody from the time of user in the crime till it was recovered from him.	Ratio
These circumstances coupled with oral evidence of PW 4 and PW 3 clearly establish the complicity of A 1 in committing the offences of murder of D 1 to D 4.	Ratio
As equally A 3 accompanied A 1 to the liquor shop and had quarrel.	Ratio
When A 1 and A 3 left the shop in anger, it is clear that they left the shop in a huff smarting from humiliation at the hands of the contractor from out side the state and their staff.	Ratio
To avenge the humiliation heaped upon them, they animated to finish the prosecution party.	Ratio
Obviously they chose past mid night to be sure that all would be asleep and no evidence of their crime would be available.	Ratio
Thus they have strong motive to kill the deceased and to make murderous attack on PW 4.	Ratio
Moreover gandasa was recovered pursuant to A 3 's statement under s.27 of 272 Evidence Act leading to its discovery and it contained human blood though blood group could not be detected due to disintegration.	Ratio
The two incised injuries each on the persons of D 3 and D 4 as corroborated by medical evidence clearly establishes the participation of A 3 in attacking the deceased.	Ratio
He accompanied A 1 at dead of night to the liquor shop and killed D 1 to D 4 and attempted to kill PW 4.	Ratio
Thus he shared with A 1 the common intention to kill the deceased D 1 to D 4 and attempt to kill PW 4.	Ratio
The production of the credit chit kept on the table in the shop would have lent corroboration to the prosecution case of the sale of liquor to A 1 and A 3 on credit.	Ratio
It is not the prosecution case that it was signed by either of the accused.	Ratio
It is now in evidence that it was burnt out also with the shop, though no definite evidence for cause of burning is on record, except vague suggestions but denied by the prosecution witnesses that the terrosists committed the arson and killings.	Ratio
From a totality of facts and circumstances it cannot be concluded that terrorists committed the offence.	Ratio
As regards A 2 we have grave doubt of his participation in the crime.	Ratio
Admittedly, he had no motive to kill any of the deceased or to attack PW 4.	Ratio
He did not come at 9.00 p.m. on June 4, 1984 to the liquor shop for drinking.	Ratio
There is no recovery of gandasa from him, though he was arrested alongwith A 1 and A 3.	Ratio
The doubt whether A 2 was likely to be a participant in the commission of this grave crime of four deaths has not been removed from our minds.	Ratio
It is undoubtedly true that PW 4 had stated that A 2 attacked him with the gandasa but when he was attacked while he was fleeing for life the possibility of mistaken identity of A 2 to A 3 cannot be ruled out.	Ratio
We make it clear that we are not doubting the veracity of PW 4.	Ratio
In these circumstances A 2 is entitled to the benefit.	Ratio
Accordingly, we hold that A 1 and A 3 have shared common intention, they had motive to kill the deceased.	Ratio
They came together, killed the sleeping innocent four persons D 1 to D 4 and also attempted to kill PW 4.	Ratio
Accordingly, we hold that A 1 committed the offence of murder of D 1 and D 2 punishable under s.302; D 3 and D 4 's under s.302 read with s.34 I.P.C. and attempt of murder of PW 4 punishable under s.307 read with s.34, I.P.C. A 3 shared the common intention with A 1 and also committed the said offences under s.302 read with s.34; s.307 read with s.34 I.P.C. A 3 was given the minimum sentence of imprisonment of life.	Ratio
The sentences were directed to run concurrently.	Ratio
273 On finding that the accused committed the charged offences, s.235(2) of the Code empowers the Judge that he shall pass sentence on him according to law on hearing him.	Ratio
Hearing contemplated is not confined merely to oral hearing but also intended to afford an opportunity to the prosecution as well as the accused to place before the Court facts and material relating to various factors on the question of sentence and if interested by either side to have evidence adduced to show mitigating circumstances to impose a lesser sentence or aggravating grounds to impose death penalty.	Ratio
Therefore, sufficient time must be given to the accused or the prosecution on the question of sentence, to show the grounds on which the prosecution may plead or the accused may show that the maximum sentence of death may be the appropriate sentence or the minimum sentence of life imprisonment may be awarded, as the case may be.	Ratio
No doubt the accused declined to adduce oral evidence.	Ratio
But it does not prevent to show the grounds to impose lesser sentence on A 1.	Ratio
This Court in the aforestated Alluddin and Anguswamy 's cases held that the sentence awarded on the same day of finding guilt is not in accordance with the law.	Ratio
That would normally have the effect of remanding the case to the Special Court for reconsideration.	Ratio
But in the view of the fact that A 1 was in incarceration for long term of six years from the date of conviction, in our considered view it needs no remand for further evidence.	Ratio
It is sufficient that the sentence of death awarded to A 1 is converted into rigorous imprisonment for life.	Ratio
The sentences of death is accordingly modified and A 1 is sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life for causing the deaths of all four deceased.	RPC
The conviction of A 1 for attempt to murder PW 4 and sentence of five years ' rigorous imprisonment is also upheld and all the sentences would run concurrently.	Ratio
A 2 is acquitted of all charges.	RPC
The bail bonds are cancelled.	RPC
He shall be set at liberty unless he is required in any other case.	RPC
The appeal is allowed only to the above extent.	RPC
V.P.R. Appeal Partly allowed.	RPC
